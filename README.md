## How to run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lalitmee/countdown-timer.git
```

### 2. Install Packages

```bash
cd countdown-timer
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### 3. Run

```bash
yarn start
# or
npm start

```

### 4. Open in the browser

After running the command `yarn start` or `npm start`, it will open the server in your default
browser. If not, you can go to your browser and put

```
localhost:3000
```

in the address bar and it will run.

- If you are still not able to run it after the last step, it means that `3000` port is occupied with some
  other process so you will have to go to other port which will be
  ```bash
  localhost:3001
  ```
  and so on.
